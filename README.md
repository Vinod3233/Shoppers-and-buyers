# üõí Shoppers & Buyers Behavior Analysis ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

##  Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 12,300+ customer purchase records across various retail environments to uncover patterns in shopping behavior. Using Python and machine learning techniques, we aim to predict purchase outcomes and extract actionable business insights to improve customer targeting and personalization.

## üß™ Key Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏èData Preprocessing

* Handled missing values and checked data types
* Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`

### 2Ô∏èExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized numeric features with `seaborn` boxplots to detect outliers
* Identified unique patterns in customer segments using `.nunique()` and `apply(lambda)`

### 3Ô∏è Model Building

* Split dataset using `train_test_split`
* Built a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict revenue/engagement
* Evaluated preliminary predictions

---

##  Tech Stack

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
* **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regressor
* **EDA**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* *(Optional deployment via Streamlit and GitHub)*

---

##  Next Steps

* Add performance metrics (RMSE, R¬≤ Score)
* Try other models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
* Streamlit deployment for interactive analysis
